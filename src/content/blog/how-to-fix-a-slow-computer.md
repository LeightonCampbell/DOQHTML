A slow computer can drain your productivity and test your patience. The good news is that many causes of sluggish performance are fixable—either by you or with professional help. This guide walks you through common causes, quick fixes you can try at home, and when it's time to call in the experts.

## Common Causes of a Slow Computer

Before you can fix the problem, it helps to understand what might be causing it. Common culprits include:

- **Too many programs running at startup** – Applications that launch with Windows or macOS can slow down boot time and consume resources in the background.
- **Low disk space** – When your hard drive is nearly full, the system has less room for temporary files and virtual memory, which can cause slowdowns.
- **Malware or viruses** – Malicious software can consume CPU, memory, and disk space, and may run in the background without your knowledge.
- **Insufficient RAM** – Modern applications and browsers use a lot of memory. If your system is constantly swapping to disk, everything will feel slow.
- **Fragmented or failing hard drive** – Mechanical hard drives can become fragmented over time; older drives may also be physically failing.
- **Overheating** – When components run too hot, the system may throttle performance to prevent damage.

## Quick Fixes You Can Try

1. **Restart your computer** – A simple restart can clear out stuck processes and free up memory.
2. **Close unnecessary programs and browser tabs** – Check your system tray and Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) to see what's using resources.
3. **Disable or remove startup programs** – In Windows, use Task Manager > Startup. On Mac, check System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items.
4. **Run disk cleanup** – Use built-in tools (Disk Cleanup on Windows, Storage Management on Mac) to remove temporary files and free space.
5. **Update your operating system and drivers** – Updates often include performance and security improvements.
6. **Scan for malware** – Run a full scan with a reputable antivirus or anti-malware tool.
