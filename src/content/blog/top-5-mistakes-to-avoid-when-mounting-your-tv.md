TV mounting might seem straightforward, but there are numerous pitfalls that can turn your DIY project into a disaster. We've seen it all—from TVs crashing to the floor to expensive wall repairs. Here are the top five mistakes people make when mounting their TVs, and how to avoid them.

## Mistake #1: Not Finding and Using Wall Studs

**This is the #1 cause of TV mounting failures.** Drywall alone cannot support the weight of a modern TV. Mounting directly into drywall will eventually fail, sending your expensive TV crashing down.

**What Happens:** Drywall anchors can only hold 20-50 pounds. Most TVs weigh 50-100+ pounds. The anchors will pull out, causing your TV to fall.

**The Fix:** Always mount into wall studs (the vertical wooden beams behind your drywall). Use a stud finder to locate them, and ensure at least two mounting points hit studs. For heavier TVs, you may need to hit three or more studs.

## Mistake #2: Mounting Too High

Many people mount their TVs too high on the wall, thinking it looks better or saves space. This creates a poor viewing experience and neck strain.

**The Problem:** When your TV is mounted too high, you have to look up constantly, causing neck and eye strain. This is especially problematic for long viewing sessions.

**The Solution:** Mount the center of your TV screen at eye level when you're seated. For most setups, this means the bottom of a 65-inch TV should be about 25-30 inches from the floor. Measure from your seating position to determine the perfect height.

## Mistake #3: Using the Wrong Mount for Your TV Size

Not all TV mounts are created equal. Using a mount rated for a smaller TV can lead to failure, while using an oversized mount can be unnecessarily expensive and bulky.

**Check the weight capacity:** Your mount must support both the weight of your TV and have a VESA pattern that matches your TV's mounting holes. A 65-inch TV might weigh 50-70 pounds, but a mount rated for 40 pounds won't work.

**Match the VESA pattern:** TVs have specific mounting hole patterns (like 200x200, 400x400, etc.). Your mount must match this pattern, or you'll need an adapter plate.

## Mistake #4: Not Planning for Cables and Connections

Nothing ruins the clean look of a mounted TV like a tangle of cables hanging down the wall. But beyond aesthetics, poor cable management can cause problems.

- **Cables too short:** You mount the TV, then realize your HDMI cables don't reach. Now you have to unmount and start over, or deal with visible extension cables.
- **No access to ports:** Mounting the TV too close to the wall makes it impossible to plug in devices or make adjustments.
- **Cable damage:** Cables pinched between the TV and wall can be damaged, causing connection issues.

Plan your cable routing before mounting. Consider [professional cable concealment](/tv-cable-concealment/) for a clean, permanent solution.

## Mistake #5: Not Checking for Hidden Hazards

Behind your wall are electrical wires, plumbing pipes, and sometimes HVAC ducts. Drilling into these can cause serious damage, injury, or expensive repairs.

**What to Check Before Drilling:**

- Electrical outlets and switches (wires run vertically and horizontally from these)
- Water pipes (especially in bathrooms or kitchens)
- HVAC vents and ducts
- Fire blocking (horizontal beams in walls)
- Existing wall anchors or hardware

Use a stud finder with wire detection, or better yet, hire a professional who has the right tools and experience to avoid these hazards.

## Bonus: Additional Common Mistakes

- **Not leveling the mount:** A crooked TV is distracting and looks unprofessional. Always use a level.
- **Over-tightening bolts:** This can strip threads or crack the TV's mounting holes. Follow manufacturer torque specifications.
- **Ignoring ventilation:** TVs need airflow. Mounting too close to the wall or blocking vents can cause overheating and damage.
- **Not testing before final installation:** Test all connections and viewing angles before fully tightening everything.

## Avoid These Mistakes with Professional Installation

While it's possible to mount a TV yourself, these common mistakes show why professional installation is often the smarter choice. Professional installers have the tools, experience, and knowledge to avoid all these pitfalls.
